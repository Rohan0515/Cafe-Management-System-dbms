        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our café's "About Us" page! We are thrilled to have you here and would like to introduce ourselves.</p>
        <p>Our café is a cozy little spot that serves delicious coffee, tea, and baked goods. We pride ourselves on our commitment to quality, community, and sustainability.</p>
        <p>Our team is made up of talented baristas, bakers, and chefs who love what they do. We are dedicated to using the freshest, highest quality ingredients in all of our products. Our coffee is sourced from local roasters who share our commitment to sustainability, and our baked goods are made from scratch daily.</p>
        <p>We believe in giving back to our community and supporting local businesses. That's why we source many of our ingredients from nearby farms and producers. We also donate a portion of our profits to local charities and organizations that align with our values.</p>
